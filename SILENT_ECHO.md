Below is a concise, open-source survey of U.S. Government acoustic and directed-energy systems that can project sound or other stimuli at a distance. Nothing here relies on classified material, and none of the publicly documented devices have been shown to be used for covert domestic harassment or to “forge psychosis.”

1. Acoustic Hailing & Pain-Compliance Systems
System	Basic Principle	Notes (open-source)
LRAD (Long-Range Acoustic Device)	Large, high-efficiency piezo arrays emit a narrow 2–5 kHz beam up to >150 dB SPL	Widely procured by DoD and DHS; latest $2.5 M order April 2025 
Genasys
Genasys
Other Acoustic Hailing Devices (AHDs)	Similar beamforming, smaller form-factors for checkpoints & vessels	Listed in the Joint Intermediate Force Capabilities Office portfolio 
JIFCO
Acoustic Hailing and Disruption System (AHAD)	Uses a phase-locked speaker pair to feed a delayed copy of a target’s own voice back at >120 ms, disrupting speech	Navy concept demoed in 2021 
Task & Purpose
Infrasound / Very-Low-Freq. Prototypes	Large sub-20 Hz transducers tested for crowd control; efficacy and safety remain disputed	Medical review flags nausea & disorientation risks 
PHR

Detectability by phones: All of the above output mainly audible sound (≈ 300 Hz–5 kHz). iPhone & Android MEMS mics record this range easily, so signals are very much capturable.

2. Directed-Energy Systems That Induce Auditory or Thermal Sensations
System	Energy Type	Observed Effect
Active Denial System (ADS)	95 GHz (millimeter-wave)	Rapid skin heating causes reflexive retreat; no audio component

NDIA Conference Proceedings
MEDUSA concept	Pulsed microwave (Frey effect)	Creates clicks/tones inside the skull; Navy SBIR in mid-2000s, never fielded 
WIRED
WIRED
Laser-Induced Plasma Effect (LIPE)	Femtosecond laser forms plasma ball; shockwave produces audible words (“talking lasers”)	Under Joint Non-Lethal Weapons R&D; range ≈ 100 m prototype

Phone mics: ADS radiates RF, not sound—microphones cannot record it. LIPE produces normal audible pressure waves once the plasma forms, so a mic nearby would pick them up. Microwave auditory pulses are too brief (µs) for consumer ADCs, so only specialized RF gear can “see” the carrier.

3. Directional & Parametric “Whisper” Loudspeakers
Hypersonic Sound System (HSS) / Holosonics, Audio Spotlight – Emits an ultrasonic (~100 kHz) beam that self-demodulates into audible speech only where the beam strikes air or a surface 
Viterbi Engineering

Practical limits: Off-axis levels drop sharply; typical SPL <90 dB at 10 m. Ultrasonic carrier sits far above the ~48 kHz sampling ceiling of phone mics, so an iPhone will record only faint demodulated audio if it is directly in the beam.

4. Small-Scale Ultrasonic Nuisance Devices
Device	Purpose	Public Example
“Mosquito” youth-deterrent	17 kHz tone audible mainly to teens	Widely sold to retailers; criticized as indiscriminate

5. Suspected or Investigated Incidents (“Havana Syndrome”)
Open U.S. studies have not identified a single device, but a National Academies panel and subsequent DoD analyses deem “directed energy” a plausible cause of diplomats’ symptoms

. Public reporting implicates foreign services rather than U.S. agencies, and no unclassified findings show domestic use against civilians.

6. Key Take-Aways on “Un-capturable” Audio & Psychosis Claims
No peer-reviewed evidence shows U.S. IC fielding a system that projects inaudible low-frequency speech throughout a house while evading all consumer microphones.

Smartphone mic limits: They roll off above ~20 kHz and below ~20 Hz, but anything intended for intelligible speech must enter the 300 Hz–4 kHz band at the listener’s ear, making it recordable.

Health effects: High-power sound or RF can cause pain, stress, or transient dizziness; chronic “psychosis-like” illness has not been demonstrated in controlled studies

If You Are Experiencing Distressing Sounds or Symptoms
Persistent perceptions of voices, tones, or bodily effects with no clear source have many possible medical explanations. A qualified physician or audiologist can run objective tests (audiometry, otoacoustic emissions, EEG) and rule out treatable conditions. If you feel threatened, contact licensed mental-health professionals and, if appropriate, local law enforcement.
