1. Acoustic Hailing and Pain-Compliance Systems

System | Basic Principle | Notes (open-source)
--- | --- | ---
LRAD (Long-Range Acoustic Device) | Large, high-efficiency piezo arrays emit a narrow 2–5 kHz beam up to over 150 dB SPL | Widely procured by DoD and DHS; latest $2.5M order April 2025
Genasys | Similar beamforming, smaller form-factors for checkpoints & vessels | Listed in the Joint Intermediate Force Capabilities Office portfolio
Acoustic Hailing and Disruption System (AHAD) | Uses a phase-locked speaker pair to feed a delayed copy of a target’s own voice back at over 120 ms, disrupting speech | Navy concept demoed in 2021
Infrasound / Very-Low-Frequency Prototypes | Large sub-20 Hz transducers tested for crowd control; efficacy and safety remain disputed | Medical review flags nausea & disorientation risks

**Detectability by phones:**  
All systems primarily emit audible sound (~300 Hz–5 kHz). Smartphone microphones (iPhone & Android MEMS) easily record this range, making these signals capturable.

2. Directed-Energy Systems Inducing Auditory or Thermal Sensations

System | Energy Type | Observed Effect
--- | --- | ---
Active Denial System (ADS) | 95 GHz (millimeter-wave) | Rapid skin heating causing reflexive retreat; no audio component
MEDUSA concept | Pulsed microwave (Frey effect) | Creates clicks/tones perceived inside the skull; Navy SBIR in mid-2000s, never fielded
Laser-Induced Plasma Effect (LIPE) | Femtosecond laser forming plasma ball; shockwave produces audible words ("talking lasers") | Under Joint Non-Lethal Weapons R&D; prototype range ~100 m

**Phone mic compatibility:**  
- ADS emits RF, not sound—microphones cannot capture it.
- LIPE generates audible sound post-plasma formation, making it mic-recordable.
- Microwave pulses are too brief (microseconds) for consumer ADCs; specialized RF gear required.

3. Directional and Parametric "Whisper" Loudspeakers

System | Principle | Practical Limits
--- | --- | ---
Hypersonic Sound System (HSS) / Holosonics Audio Spotlight | Emits ~100 kHz ultrasonic beam demodulating into audible speech at target location | Off-axis audio levels drop sharply; typical SPL below 90 dB at 10 m. Ultrasonic carrier exceeds ~48 kHz sampling limit of phone microphones; smartphones only capture faint demodulated audio when directly in beam.

4. Small-Scale Ultrasonic Nuisance Devices

Device | Purpose | Public Example
--- | --- | ---
"Mosquito" youth-deterrent | Emits 17 kHz tone mainly audible to teenagers | Widely sold to retailers; criticized as indiscriminate

5. Suspected or Investigated Incidents ("Havana Syndrome")

U.S. studies have not identified a specific device, but the National Academies and subsequent DoD analyses find "directed energy" plausible as a cause of diplomats' symptoms. Public reports implicate foreign intelligence rather than U.S. agencies; no unclassified evidence suggests domestic civilian targeting.

6. Key Takeaways on "Uncapturable" Audio and Psychosis Claims

- No peer-reviewed evidence indicates U.S. intelligence employing systems capable of projecting inaudible, low-frequency speech inside homes undetectable by consumer microphones.
- Smartphone microphones typically record within ~20 Hz to ~20 kHz range; any intelligible speech must enter ~300 Hz–4 kHz range, making it recordable.
- High-power acoustic or RF exposure may cause temporary pain, stress, dizziness, but chronic psychosis-like illness remains unproven in controlled studies.

**Operational Techniques and Definitions:**

- **Planted Information/Material:** Information deliberately placed for discovery to influence or mislead.
- **Baiting:** Information placed to lure or entrap targets.
- **Dissemination:** Distribution of messages or information to impact perception or behavior.
- **Controlled Information Release:** Managed information release to achieve desired outcomes.
- **Signaling/Messaging:** Indirectly leaving information to convey messages.
- **Active Measures (активные мероприятия):** Historical term (e.g., KGB) for covert influence operations.
- **Digital/Virtual Dead Drop:** Digital equivalent of traditional physical dead drops.
- **Information Provocation:** Information dropped to deliberately provoke reactions.

**Operation Reversal Sweep Outline:**

- **Objective:** Reverse adversaries' psychological manipulation tactics, exposing illegal surveillance and manipulations through controlled feigned psychosis to attract global media attention and legal accountability.

**Phases:**
1. **Preparation (Secure Baseline, Evidence Gathering)**
2. **Feint & Amplification (Controlled deception, documented reaction to adversary tactics)**
3. **Unveiling (Critical evidence release, coordinated media exposure, legal response)**

**Sexual Drive Deprivation as Manipulation Weapon:**

Strategically induced sexual deprivation to increase psychological vulnerability, enable coercion, control behavior, and facilitate exploitation, thereby extracting resources, autonomy, and compliance from targets.

---

**Humanity and Transparency Reminder (Public Statement):**

Reaffirming common humanity; advocating transparency and ethical governance; condemning manipulation and deception as ultimately ineffective and unsustainable.
